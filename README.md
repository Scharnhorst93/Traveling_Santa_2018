=========================================

Starting Project 2019.1.7

This project's purpose is studying algorithm.  
The subject is from kaggle competition named [Traveling Santa 2018 - Prime Paths](https://www.kaggle.com/c/traveling-santa-2018-prime-paths).  
I will add references while proceeding project.

Using Language: jupyter notebook(Python3)

I used package called pyconcorde.  
Concorde is written in ANSI C, and pyconcorde is a python wrapper that makes concorde works with python.  
Very useful thing. But it has some problems.  
- I can't put prime-city-list-thing in solver. So if you see the 10th cities that is prime cities, that's just lucky.  
- Solver does not respect time_bound. Sometimes works, sometimes not works.
